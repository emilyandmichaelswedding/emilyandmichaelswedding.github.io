# Gifts

Thank you so much for your thoughtful consideration of a wedding gift. The bride and groom have the happy (modern) problem of fitting two apartments' worth of belongings into a single city apartment. In lieu of physical gifts, they suggest the gift of fun honeymoon experiences or a contribution towards their starter home fund.
