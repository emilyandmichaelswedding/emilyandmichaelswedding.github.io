# Your Trip to Victoria

We're so thrilled for you to join us for this June in Victoria, British Columbia, Canada. We hope that the information below is useful as you plan your trip. This is an opinionated guide based on what has worked for the bride and groom in their myriad travels to Victoria over the years.

## Getting to Victoria

Victoria is located on Vancouver Island. Despite the name, the city of Vancouver is *not* on Vancouver Island. For this reason, you can either fly directly into Victoria, or fly into Vancouver and take a ferry or sea plane to the island. You *cannot* drive directly from Vancouver to Victoria.

### Way 1: Flying to Victoria International Airport (YYJ)

This is generally the most convenient way to get to Victoria.

#### Travel Overview
- Fly to Victoria International Airport (YYJ).
- Drive ~40 minutes downtown. You can take an Uber, taxi, or bus. You can also consider renting a car; rental car services are available at YYJ.

### Way 2: Flying to YVR, then taking BC Ferries to Swartz Bay

This is a great option if you're looking to experience the picturesque beauty of the Gulf Islands via BC Ferries. (In the summer, the islands are beautifully lush, and sometimes you can spot dolphins or whales!) Alternatively, you may consider this option if flights to Vancouver are significantly cheaper than flights to Victoria for you.

#### Travel Overview
- Fly to Vancouver International Airport (YVR).
- Get to Tsawwassen Ferry Terminal. There are a few options:
    - Public Transit: Take the Canada Line to Bridgeport Station, then board the 620 bus to Tsawwassen (~xx minutes).
    - Car: Take an Uber/taxi (~xx minutes).
- Purchase a ticket to BC Ferries (to Swartz Bay). Ferries run roughly once every two hours, cost ~$20/person, and last 90 minutes.
- From Swartz Bay, take an Uber, taxi, or bus downtown (~40 minutes). Note that there are *no* car rental options at the Swartz Bay ferry terminal.

### Way 3: Sea Plane from Vancouver or Seattle

Another way to access Victoria is via Sea Plane from either Vancouver or Seattle. These are propeller planes that take off and land on water. You can take one from either Vancouver or Seattle to Victoria Harbour. The plane lands downtown, directly on the Inner Harbour, where most of events take place.

## Getting Around Victoria (Once you're here)

Once you are downtown, all of our wedding venues are located conveniently within walking distance. Thus, if you are staying downtown, you should not need to rely heavily on Uber/taxi or public transportation to make your way around.

In the downtown Inner Harbour area (where most of our events will take place), Victoria has a  Harbour Ferry service (known to locals as the "water taxis") that transports passengers to Harbourside locations in brightly-colored small boats. We recommend making use of this service both as a way of getting around and as a fun experience!

Victoria has Uber. However, Uber is relatively new to the area, and its network is less robust than the ones in many major U.S. cities (e.g., Bay Area, Boston, New York). For our friends traveling from the United States, please note that a slightly longer wait time can be normal and plan accordingly.

Victoria has a public bus system that can get you between downtown and other parts of the city. However, if you're interested in exploring more of the Island on your own, you may consider renting a car for greater convenience.
